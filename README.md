## Getting Set Up

The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. I recommend using the LTS version.

1. Start by creating a local repository for this folder.

1. In the repo root directory, open a terminal and run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

1. Next, on the terminal, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

1. Then run `npm start` which should start the server.


## How to start the server on Debug Mode

1. Open the terminal and run `npm run debug`
